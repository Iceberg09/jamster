# Jamster

## What is Jamster?
<p>Jamster is an application to help musicians with similar interests meet up and jam!</p>

## How it works
<p>Start by creating an account. Username, password, what instrument you play and you skill level.
After that it's completely up to you! Do you want to create a jam session and let others come to you? Or do you want to search for groups that need a position filled that you qualify for?</p>

## The Motivation
<p>Looking at some of the other apps out there, we noticed poor user experience and navigation. Some sites weren't even responsive! We wanted to take something away from that and create the best user experience we can for our users.</p>

## What sets Jamster apart from other similar apps?
<p>We strive for the best user experience and standards we are capable of. Our site will be fully responsive and mobile friendly. We want our site to be modern and easily maintanable through the implementation of React and other innovative libraries.</p>
